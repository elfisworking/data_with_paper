[2021-01-01 04:07:54] <digimbyte> HELLO, I was wondering if anyone knew how to import materialize within a react/next app? all the examples use script tag importsthe only reference I found was how to install the npm module
[2021-01-01 04:08:33] <digimbyte> I doubt I would import the css/js again with the script tags when I have the node module
[2021-01-01 04:09:30] <digimbyte> I assume this is how I get startedimport Materialize from 'materialize-css'
[2021-01-01 04:09:48] <digimbyte> but not sure what to do to apply it to my react/next app
[2021-01-01 04:14:48] <digimbyte> or would I be better with MDBootstrap for next?
[2021-01-01 09:38:56] <RafaelZasas> Does anyone know how to get the dropdown to work in Angular? I've tried everything :(
[2021-01-01 15:30:24] <doughballs> digimbyte: have you read this? [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-01 15:31:39] <doughballs> RafaelZasas: make sure you initialise the dropdown after the render, and make sure you take out the options variable if you’re not using options.
[2021-01-01 17:14:02] <RafaelZasas> doughballs: I've initialized everything in the After View Init lifecycle method and the modals works, the forms work but the dropdown does not
[2021-01-01 17:33:31] <tuffant21> RafaelZasas: Check out [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-01 17:34:29] <tuffant21> If you need any help, shoot me a message
[2021-01-01 17:36:56] <RafaelZasas> I just tried both the trigger and the <ul> outside of the *ngFor loop and it worked. Is there any way to get it to work within the loop? I'm trying to have options display on multiple cards pulled from a database
[2021-01-01 17:38:33] <RafaelZasas> Hey, I tried using ngx-materialize and it stopped my other materialize components from working, will this do the same?
[2021-01-01 19:02:52] <tuffant21> RafaelZasas: this package shouldn't interfere with your other materialize components. Though I would suggest maybe switching your other components to use this library? It's really just a wrapper to get materialize to work with angular
[2021-01-04 06:56:06] <Memiin> Hi guys, I would like to make a question, I believe I did an improvement in the materialize select, I created the itemSelect event, is there a way I can shared ?
[2021-01-04 06:56:11] <Memiin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-04 06:57:22] <Memiin> Now everytime the user clicks an option in the select the event is triggers, works for multiple and non multiple selects

[2021-01-04 08:11:21] <doughballs> Hi@Memiinmaybe open a feature request over at the fork [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-04 08:13:16] <doughballs> I was under the impression that this already exists though,instance.getSelectedValues()
[2021-01-04 09:20:35] <Memiin> doughballs: instance.getSelectedValues() exist, but there is no callback when the selectedItem changes
[2021-01-04 12:45:02] <guyk-yahoo> Hey.Any idea why this happens? [<-ISSUE->] 
[2021-01-04 12:45:16] <guyk-yahoo> The update i made was upgrading to Parcel2
[2021-01-04 12:45:26] <guyk-yahoo> Anything I should do differently?
[2021-01-04 13:14:35] <doughballs> Memiin: bring it up at the fork, hopefully it will be be considered for implementing!
[2021-01-04 22:03:55] <Fomundi> When could they upload more things to materialize as experimental things, since more things are needed and if they can they could go to the new version?
[2021-01-05 15:51:21] <pauld0051> Hey there - I am having a lot of troubles with a Materialize select element. The first thing I am struggling with is you can not do an onchange() call for JS. I am really struggling to find a way around this. Also, this same select dropdown menu is small. I can't change its size. I already changed the size of other dropdown-content classes on another page in this site. So, I am wanting to target this particular ID for the select to make it wider. Any help greatly appreciated. Really stuck on this one.
[2021-01-06 09:19:38] <doughballs> Many ways to achieve this. Pass constrainWidth:false as an option inside dropdownOptions when initialising the select. In any case, you can always set a width on .dropdown-content.
[2021-01-06 09:45:43] <doughballs> pauld0051: also, onchange works just fine: [<-CODE->] 
[2021-01-06 09:45:59] <doughballs>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-06 11:22:54] <pauld0051> Yeah, I found out that it was my template and where the script was being called as the problem. It was a painful few hours when I worked that out. The onchange isn't needed now, but it does work :) Thanks for the reply too.
[2021-01-06 11:46:25] <pauld0051> I do have a question though about the Materialize datepicker. I am wanting users to just pick their birthday "day" (ie, month and day) but not how old they are. So I don't need them to pick year. But when ever I try to turn the year off, I seem to prevent the whole datepicker from working. Is there a simple way to just allow a user to pick 1 day of the 366 possible days (ie, will need to keep February 29th in regardless of the year)?
[2021-01-06 12:57:25] <doughballs> @pauld0051 sounds like the datepicker is not for you. Just give the user a simple text field and ask for DD/MMThe datepicker is set up to change the days to the correct ones depending on what year it is.

[2021-01-09 01:58:22] <EricTomphone> need your guys help for one question... maybe stupid since I'm just a beginner..
[2021-01-09 01:58:41] <EricTomphone> how to customize the table font size....i have a table showing as below..

[2021-01-09 01:59:27] <EricTomphone> thx...
[2021-01-09 02:06:40] <EricTomphone> hi... ok, after hundreds tryies... I got it...add Style="font-size: xx px"simple liek that..
[2021-01-09 03:31:02] <tuffant21> nice!
[2021-01-09 03:54:41] <bassamanator> I love the font styling that is used in MaterializeCSS but I can't seem to be able to replicate it elsewhere. I want to experiment a bit. How do I replicate the the exact way the text looks?
[2021-01-09 05:09:58] <ManuTheCoder> It's roboto i think
[2021-01-09 05:09:59] <ManuTheCoder>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-09 17:22:23] <bassamanator> Well when I set the font to Roboto, things don't look quite the same. This is the closest I've gotten to reproducing what materialize looks like but it's still slightly off I think [<-CODE->]

[2021-01-09 18:15:52] <doughballs>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-09 18:51:02] <bassamanator> doughballs: That helps a lot. Thanks!
[2021-01-09 19:05:17] <doughballs> 
[2021-01-09 19:37:37] <pauld0051> I have formalised my issue now with Materialize, I am aware now that the select styling isn't conducive to letting Javascript change select attributes.For example: I was using a backend JSON file to populate a Materialize select dropdown with every country on Earth. A user would pick that, and then JS would listen to the variable being chosen (or loaded) and then populate a second dropdown with all the states. After a lot of fussing around, I got some JS to do this. But this was 5 days for something as simple as an adding an attribute function. I am still not 100% comfortable with how I finally got it to work. But I still have one more issue to solve - I need the original choice to remain in the select function regardless of the JS.I can't seem to work that last part out. But that might not be for this forum. The first part is though.
[2021-01-09 20:42:45] <doughballs> “ I need the original choice to remain in the select function regardless of the JS.” I don’t really understand what you’re trying to do.
[2021-01-09 23:34:00] <bassamanator> So I just checked 2 machines, Firefox and Chrome (Win10 and Linux) and Roboto is not the font that is being rendered, it's in factFont being Rendered:
Segoe UI
100.0% (local). This is also the case with the font on materializecss.com. I was expecting to see Roboto as the font being rendered. Does this make sense?
[2021-01-10 17:17:54] <pauld0051> Apologies - I worked out my issue there with select function. It's all good.But I am still having problems with datepicker. If A user picks 1970 for example, and I have a 99 year max... all of a sudden they can then pick 1870 too!How do I set a minimum date as far back as it can go? I tried this in the JS file: min: new Date(1910,1,1), but this didn't seem to work.
[2021-01-10 17:54:33] <doughballs> Pass this as an option when initialising:minDate: new Date('2020-01-13')
[2021-01-10 18:01:57] <doughballs> @bassamanator [<-CODE->] pretty sure the fonts will render in that order, as per the css
[2021-01-10 19:20:35] <pauld0051> Here's an example of how I can keep going back in time on the Datepicker. [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 19:21:04] <pauld0051> I tried the minDate: new Date('various dates') and this didn't seem to prevent it.
[2021-01-10 19:25:51] <bassamanator> doughballs: I'd be curious to know what results you get if you check to see what font is actually being rendered on your machine using the extension Font Finder (Firefox+Chrome) or Whatfont(Chrome).
[2021-01-10 19:27:14] <doughballs> @pauld0051 [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 19:31:47] <pauld0051> Thanks Sean. Appreciate that. I wonder why it's not a simple code within the Query? Ok - appreciate the link will copy and paste that into the file. Thanks again.
[2021-01-10 19:36:05] <pauld0051> Ok, I can't seem to get that to work either. Hmmmm...
[2021-01-10 19:38:37] <pauld0051> Wait, do I have to replace all this as well?$('.datepicker').datepicker({format: "dd mmmm, yyyy",yearRange: 99,showClearBtn: true,selectMonths: true,i18n: {done: "Select"}});
[2021-01-10 19:44:23] <pauld0051> I wished there was much better documentation at the Materialize site that shows this.
[2021-01-10 19:55:21] <doughballs> The documentation isn’t great but it contains everything you need - re read it, and play around, and make sure you are using the correct formats. [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 19:56:06] <ManuTheCoder> Hi there I was wondering why my code isnt working. The onOpenEnd thing isnt working with jQuery. [<-CODE->] 
[2021-01-10 19:57:01] <doughballs> Your date format doesn’t look right - mmmm - never seen this. Yyyy for sure, but not mmmm.
[2021-01-10 19:58:50] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 19:59:13] <pauld0051> So I tried that. And this doesn't prevent the date picker from continually winding down the clock.
[2021-01-10 20:00:10] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 20:15:35] <doughballs> Then there is an error in your code. Check the console? And remove everything other than the minDate, then add back in one by one, and check the console each time.
[2021-01-10 20:16:00] <doughballs> It is minDate, not min.
[2021-01-10 20:17:55] <pauld0051> ahhh, ok I will try. Thanks.
[2021-01-10 20:23:08] <pauld0051> I removed everything. I could still go back in time, but I just couldn't select a date. But I could keep going back.
[2021-01-10 20:27:12] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 20:27:54] <pauld0051> I tried it this way - I removed everything. But it would still go back. Now, it doesn't just go back, it goes forward too :P
[2021-01-10 20:42:41] <doughballs> You don’t need all the other options. Strip it right back to just minDate. It works, you can see it works from my example - you have an error somewhere else. By adding the other options in one by one you will find it.
[2021-01-10 21:19:30] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 21:19:32] <pauld0051> Cool, I am trying, honestly. Here's what I stripped it down to.
[2021-01-10 21:19:57] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-10 21:20:16] <pauld0051> Here's me at 1911. Now, granted, I can not pick a date here. But I can get back to that part of the code.
[2021-01-11 07:09:35] <EricTomphone> Hi guys, can I ask one question here about HTMLCollection List? although it's not too much Materialize related. thx in advance.
[2021-01-11 07:11:29] <EricTomphone> I have a dynamic check list, using Array map function, get it from Google spreadsheet. as below pic..
[2021-01-11 07:11:34] <EricTomphone>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-11 07:13:15] <EricTomphone> the list appears on Web app successfully... with checkbox in front of each item.
[2021-01-11 07:16:31] <EricTomphone> however I'm not able to change the checkbox status to do some other stuff, e.g.if checklist[0].checked,document.getElementById('inputarea').value = "checked";
[2021-01-11 07:16:48] <EricTomphone> else {document.getElementById('inputarea').value = "not checked";}
[2021-01-11 07:17:07] <doughballs> pauld0051: great so that is working as it should. It sets the minimum date that can be selected.

[2021-01-11 07:17:46] <EricTomphone>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-11 07:39:07] <doughballs> EricTomphone: have you  looked on SO? [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-11 07:45:31] <doughballs> pauld0051: So it sounds like you need to add a max date if you want to cap the latest selectable date. The yearRange refers to the year dropdown - how many years are shown. The user can still click back and forward through the months, but since the dates are not selectable, it's not a big problem.
[2021-01-11 07:57:47] <EricTomphone> doughballs: thanks bro... I hv checked that post, sorry I'm still not able to make it work...
[2021-01-11 08:30:14] <doughballs> EricTomphone: so what exactly do you need to do? Set a checkbox as checked, or not checked? Is this at time of render, or onto a pre-rendered set of checkboxes?
[2021-01-11 08:33:45] <EricTomphone> doughballs: Hi bro, I have just found a video talking about the dynamic checkboxand also the chips appear once item checked... that;s what I'm looking for. :)
[2021-01-11 08:34:13] <EricTomphone> thanks a lot, let me go thru the video, and will ask again if I still have troubles..

By default, it is true, but I want to set it to false.  On ver 0.100.2 in the site, there was documentation for changing options in line by adding them as data attributes. I've tried it on ver 1 but it hasn't worked. I've also tried experimenting with other options.So TLDR, I wanted to know if there is a way to quickly change one or two options of a JS element without having to dive into JSQuery since I don't really know it.

[2021-01-24 12:17:39] <medens92> Ho to everybody, i m Daniele from Italy. I am building a web site with the parallax template of materializecss. I would like to transform the first parallax image in a full page slider with parallax effect and i would like to make the navbar fixed and black with a little opacity to make it over the slider that i will build. I try to do those things but I did not succeed in. Can someone of you help me?thanks you guys.
[2021-01-25 10:46:53] <doughballs> @medens92 yo. A little bit tricky this as you're nesting a component inside a component, and both of these components rely heavily on relative>absolute positioning, but it is possible.Not sure if you want to have the user access the slider, but I couldn't seem to get to it, maybe because of what I mention above. Hopefully should get you started though.https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/wvzLPYw

[2021-01-25 18:55:12] <nelsongil> Hi, I am updating my knowledge and I love Materialize, but I have a problem when loading code from Javascript in the  page, inside a div, Materialize stops working for me, if I write the same code directly on the page it works .Code page report.php
[2021-01-25 18:59:11] <nelsongil> Use '''$('#divBotones').html(cadena);''''
[2021-01-25 18:59:39] <nelsongil> in informe.js
[2021-01-26 08:00:13] <doughballs> nelsongil: make sure to initialise any JavaScript components after they have been added to the page.
[2021-01-26 09:17:37] <nelsongil> Thanks@doughballs, I found a solution, its becouse datapicker doesn`t exist when a call it, with this work: "let DateP = document.querySelectorAll('#divBotones .datepicker');let instancesDP = M.Datepicker.init(DateP);"
[2021-01-26 09:35:56] <doughballs> nelsongil: that's because your JS should be wrapped in a document.ready, and then any further dynamically added elements need to be re-init.
[2021-01-26 09:46:04] <medens92> doughballs: thank you so much. I ve tried to do this but it didn t work. I think i had something wrong. Thank again mate.

[2021-01-27 12:15:25] <chak> Hello, materialize looks awesome. Just looking over the examples, I had a question about the 'dropdown' javascript. It looks like the image is placed above the link text rather than to the left. Is that intentional?
[2021-01-27 12:17:26] <doughballs> chak: hard to tell what you mean...some components have images with dropdown options and it’s usually to the right.
[2021-01-27 13:51:39] <chak> doughballs: I'm referring specifically to the example on the website shown when you click "Drop me!" ( [<-LINK->] ). It doesn't look the way I'd expect.

[2021-01-29 08:48:58] <doughballs> darthgween: you mean before onOpenStart? You’d probably need to listen for a click on .modal-trigger.

[2021-01-29 10:37:47] <doughballs> darthgween: onOpenStart is a function built into the modal. It runs when the modal BEGINS to open.

[2021-01-29 21:08:40] <computerwiz12890> I'm about to pull my hair out with this.... I need "display:block" in order to have a scrollbar with my <tbody>, but when I use "display:block", it makes everything funky
[2021-01-29 21:08:41] <computerwiz12890>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-29 21:09:12] <computerwiz12890> Can anyone help me figure this out?  Need the table body to show scrollbar, and have the headers line up
[2021-01-29 21:10:34] <computerwiz12890> You would think it was a simple task.  But apparently not.  Or I don't know enough HTML....  :-/
[2021-01-29 22:14:44] <doughballs> computerwiz12890: I'm not really sure what you're trying to do, there is no scroll bar on your example? I can't even see why you'd need a scroll bar. Materialize has atable-responsiveclass for taking care of that on mobile. Also you have cols inside your th, which is not part of the docs and will add complexity to the css.
[2021-01-29 22:17:12] <computerwiz12890>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-29 22:17:19] <computerwiz12890> There's my scroll bar.
[2021-01-29 22:17:57] <computerwiz12890> You don't see a need for a scrollbar because that is just a test sample.  It is part of a notes screen, and there can be a lot of notes.  It will also be what I use in many other "tabled" locations.
[2021-01-29 22:18:23] <computerwiz12890> None of the "apps" I build will be used on mobile, so I don't think that class will help me.
[2021-01-29 22:19:40] <doughballs> You can force that class at any screen size you like. Just adjust the media query.
[2021-01-29 22:22:18] <doughballs> My point is, you're adding the grid system to a table - two things with conflicting styles, different display and sizing properties  - so making order out of that might not be easy.I think the responsive table class is not what you need, as you want the scroll bar in the opposite axis.
[2021-01-29 22:28:23] <computerwiz12890> I see.  I do like the % sizing that I get from the "s1 s2 s3, etc." classes.  Would it be better to just do the % myself?
[2021-01-31 10:01:26] <doughballs> It might not be causing a problem tbh. I didn’t have a chance to have a proper dig around.
[2021-01-31 10:03:54] <doughballs> I’ll see if I get a minute a lunch...
[2021-01-31 19:48:03] <doughballs> @computerwiz12890 https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/GRNgOKoFound the answer on SO:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21168521/table-fixed-header-and-scrollable-bodyYou may need to play around with it, but the key is the wrapper around the table...
[2021-02-01 15:48:32] <computerwiz12890> It's very very close@doughballs.  I run into a problem when I want 2 rows in the header.  In some of my tables, I have an "addition" row, where I allow the user to add a new entry into the table.  I love this method, because it is intuitive and easy.  But having 2 rows in the header goes funky with the "sticky" method.
[2021-02-01 15:49:54] <computerwiz12890> Originally, I was using a <table> for the header, a <table> for the addition row, and a <table> for all the records.  Works fine in IE, but in Firefox, Chrome, and Edge, I will get random rows suddenly not lining up.  Since each "row" is actually it's own table, that kinda sorta makes sense.  But the classes & min-widths and other techniques I use would make sure they line up perfectly fine....in IE.
[2021-02-01 15:51:08] <computerwiz12890> Looks like what I need to do is go back to my method of using a <table> for the header, <table> for the addition row, and <table> for the records.  But instead of wrapping the <table> in the ASP.Net Repeater, I will wrap the <tr> in the repeater.  That way instead of a <table> being created for each row of data, it will create a <tr> for each row of data.
[2021-02-01 15:52:18] <computerwiz12890> I was hoping to have it all in a single table, and everything would just line up correctly, but it seems that's not going to work.
[2021-02-02 09:37:49] <doughballs> computerwiz12890: when you says 'goes funky' - how exactly? I would have thought you just need to set a new height and offset...
[2021-02-02 09:42:35] <doughballs> Also...how strange that the only browser it works in is IE! Usually the other way around...
[2021-02-02 14:20:33] <computerwiz12890> Lol yes, exactly.When I say "goes funky", I mean the 2nd row will slide under the 1st one.  Like it's just a regular data row.  And I don't think that method will work, because I'm also trying to account for smaller resolutions/window sizes.  Different sizes can cause some headers to wrap & take up more space, so I don't think the "sticky" solution would work, because you'd have to know ahead of time exactly how much height you'd need, correct?

[2021-02-03 18:19:22] <doughballs> medens92: that’s a browser issue. I think you need to set outline:none on the trigger

I've tried so many different options, and feel lost.I'm trying to place the complimentary colors card just beneath "update"delete" buttons in the item card. but without pushing the photo and upload/delete card to a stacked arrangement. Any thoguths you have woudl be helpful.
[2021-02-03 18:57:36] <calmlb>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-03 18:57:59] <calmlb> i've included a photo of the site i'm working on and the code for the delete, update, and complimentary colors card so that you'd have more context.
[2021-02-03 19:15:00] <doughballs> @calmlb one way this can happen is if you have two columns (left and right), and in the left goes north face, delete, colours. Then the image in the second column.Alternatively, masonry layout is what you want (the cards to take up empty white space)
[2021-02-03 19:15:52] <doughballs> computerwiz12890: I guess, but you can remedy this with media queries at each breakpoint to set new appropriate css values...
[2021-02-03 19:19:55] <khalilkhamassi-ui> hey guys, am new here and new to materialize in general, i just want to ask how to make a logo responsive in the navbar ? like if i change the size of the navbar the logo changes with it ?
[2021-02-03 19:22:21] <calmlb> oh thank you Sean! Yes, I see now that I've got new rows declared which is pushing stuff around. So i have to make sure i abide by the columns in terms of where i'm putting the div's.
[2021-02-03 19:22:30] <doughballs> khalilkhamassi-ui: with media queries. Or by setting the height to be 100% and top and bottom padding say 8px. That way, if nav changes height, so will the logo, but always retain spacing.

[2021-02-03 19:56:36] <computerwiz12890> @doughballs I'm gonna have to "drop 10 & punt" on this issue.  I've spent waaaaaaay to much time trying to figure it out.  I'm going to move the <asp:Repeater> tag to encompass the <tr> instead of the entire <table>.  That solves the issue of the records spontaneously not lining up.  The header & "addition row" are their own <table> elements still.  And as such, I see the header ever so slightly off alignment from the records (only in instances with many columns), even though it has the exact same classes & min-width settings.  It's just enough to trigger someone with OCD, but not enough to look terrible.I'll use margins or padding to fix that....when someone actually brings it up as an issue.  Not the best solution, but it's the one I'm going with in order to finally move on to bigger, better things.Thanks for your assistance!
[2021-02-03 21:43:54] <ozyx> Hi everyone. I'm attempting to convert a series of checkboxes to a Materialize Multiselect on our project. I'm trying to add a "Select All" element at the top of the multiselect, and I can get it to "check" each element, but when I close the dropdown and open it back up, only the elements which were "clicked" are selected. Anybody know how to make these changes persistent with the multiselect?
[2021-02-03 21:44:53] <ozyx> Right now I'm setting the internal checkboxes to 'checked' (within theulwrapper container).
[2021-02-03 21:55:37] <ozyx> Let me know if I can clarify anything. I'll try to put together a jsfiddle that illustrates what's happening.
[2021-02-04 08:55:48] <doughballs> ozyx: you could do with with JS? trigger a click on each one perhaps?
[2021-02-04 15:59:52] <computerwiz12890> Does anyone know how to trick Firefox into downloading an updated .css or .js file?  In IE it was easy....you just rename the link like this: [<-CODE->] With the "?v=002" at the end.  But that doesn't seem to work in Firefox.  It hangs on to the old version of the file.
[2021-02-04 16:01:23] <doughballs> computerwiz12890: change the name completely, but version numbering works for me
[2021-02-04 16:03:29] <computerwiz12890> I figured that would work.  I was hoping I wouldn't have to rename the actual file.  Wouldn't that make it a bit harder when viewing the file in versioning software (like GitHub Desktop) since it would be a new file every time, and you wouldn't be able to easily see what you changed?
[2021-02-04 16:08:00] <doughballs> computerwiz12890: will I wouldn't do that myself, but that is one way. Like I say, i timestamp my css on each save, and this works for me.

[2021-02-07 12:31:21] <Zee98> hi, i need to run a function of js when the modal opens or ready. and another function when that modal closes or at complete?
[2021-02-07 12:31:43] <Zee98> I am trying to do it. but it does not work!
[2021-02-07 12:32:44] <Zee98> and by the way, I am making image crop modal. if you know or have done it before, please mention it.
[2021-02-07 12:51:42] <doughballs> Zee98: there are inbuilt functions that do this. onOpenStart, onOpenEnd, onCloseStart, onCloseEnd. Run an anonymous function for whichever you need.
[2021-02-07 12:55:07] <doughballs> GerritKuilder: you would load modal data the same as anywhere else. Create a placeholder for the data, then use JS to populate it. As for sticky nav and footer - what do you mean exactly? There is a fixed navbar example in the documentation and sticky footer would just be a couple of lines of css, position: fixed, bottom:0 and of course remember to add padding-bottom to your main container that is equivalent to the height of the footer.
[2021-02-07 13:04:28] <Zee98> i am new to this.@doughballsthank you so much. that helped.
[2021-02-07 13:09:26] <doughballs> Zee98: no problem, holler if you still have problems

[2021-02-07 19:58:14] <AlbertTundy> Howdy, so I'm super new to coding (maybe a month in) but I'm trying to got a modal to trigger off of an if else statement rather then from a button click. I'm not sure what I'm missing.
[2021-02-07 20:29:29] <doughballs> AlbertTundy: first get the modal to open. A single line should do it : $(‘.modal’).modal(‘open’); I believe, if you only have one on the page, or use an ID as the selector. This is with jQuery. Once you get the modal opening, then make sure the if else is working properly by console logging each route. Then pop it in. If you’re using vanilla is, get the modal using get instance, then instance.open, or instance[0].open

[2021-02-08 21:36:59] <doughballs> tomaswilhelmsson: I can’t answer that question...for me, I use Wordpress and body classes to activate the active state of nav links. Also...what do you mean by magic? As in, you’re leaving a lot of the logic up to the framework?
[2021-02-08 21:38:21] <tomaswilhelmsson> doughballs: well i want to see what happends like me explicitly using the querySelectorAll , than i know what objects im targeting and its easier to find problems imo =)
[2021-02-08 21:39:01] <tomaswilhelmsson> compared to "InitAll" that there is quite little info in what the classes it targets etc =) i learn more when i need to explicitly tell what class i want targeted =)
[2021-02-08 21:47:01] <doughballs> Well for instance not many sites use more than one sidenav. So it’s fine in this case to use query selector on the generic sidenav class. But you can be very specific and target by ID, or any other class name you choose, which will return the specific element. If you have many components all with the same options/behaviour, then you can use, say, querySelectorAll on .modal, which returns an array of all modals on the page and inits them at once. But can can also just target by ID individually. Personally I never use autoinit. And I compile my js file to include just the js components used on the project, and init individually.
[2021-02-08 21:48:58] <doughballs> If you look into getInstance, then instance.el (I think!) will return the specific component along with all the data attached to it.
[2021-02-09 00:14:03] <ManuTheCoder> Hi! I get this error in chrome when using Materialize:Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive.Could anyone pls help me?Thx
[2021-02-09 08:41:59] <tomaswilhelmsson> Hmm solved my problem using a href="#" v-on:click="goTo('page')" then in goTo i push the router and when its done pushing i call init on the tabs again (as the router doesnt update the whole page it didnt work when stuff got changed to active, maybe add an updateIndicator function to the tab class that rechecks for active classes for this kind of pages? or is there one? =)
[2021-02-09 09:01:06] <tomaswilhelmsson> ah a doesnt need href even ? =) quite new to this so :P
[2021-02-09 11:22:44] <doughballs> @ManuTheCoder check the fork for details on how to fix:materializecss/materialize#20
[2021-02-09 12:54:36] <pasha1110> hello guys, i want to ask, how do I make the tabs on the materialize CSS in the bottom position, thank you
[2021-02-09 15:46:26] <tomaswilhelmsson> can you use accoridon style collapse in a table using materialize ? if user clicks a table row i want a field under that row to expand for more info about that row
[2021-02-09 15:52:08] <doughballs> @tomaswilhelmsson I never got this to work, but I mimicked table style with an accordion:https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/NWNbvzW
[2021-02-09 15:56:11] <tomaswilhelmsson> that looked nice i got this using an ul inside each table row: [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-09 15:56:27] <tomaswilhelmsson> but those seperators would be nice to get rid of
[2021-02-09 16:29:00] <tomaswilhelmsson> doughballs: your table was quite nice .. maybe a bit of a pita to work with but works .. all tho if i click on the header im getting an: Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'getComputedStyle' on 'Window': parameter 1 is not of type 'Element'
[2021-02-09 16:31:50] <tomaswilhelmsson> ah using vue it was easy .. v-on:click.prevent
[2021-02-09 16:31:52] <tomaswilhelmsson> =)
[2021-02-09 16:42:46] <tomaswilhelmsson>  [<-LINK->] well doesnt look to chabby =) tho i guess pagination and stuff will mess me up like crazy :P
[2021-02-09 16:50:12] <tomaswilhelmsson> Ah, atleast getting one in there wasnt to hard .. then for the functionality of it but thats a later problem =) thanks for the stuffs@doughballs
[2021-02-10 08:26:57] <doughballs> tomaswilhelmsson: no problem. So would up you recommend vue? I have a friend trying to persuade me to use it.
[2021-02-10 13:35:24] <albertocarlassare86> hi! I'm using Materialize as framework for a private Web App I'm developing with App Script. The framework works great but default font and some default alignments are not exact the same as the documentation. For example, The text in the <th> of a table isn't different as normal <td> text; the tab isn't centered; the text inside a <li> collection isn't properly aligned. Do I am missing something. See this screenshot. I didn't do any css coding.

[2021-02-10 15:38:56] <shaney80> Is there any easy way to get only certain portions of the JS components?  My main issue is that our existing app is already using the Jquery UI DatePicker which has an init method of .datePicker().  I'd like to start transitioning using some of the materialize components (mainly chips for now) but if I put the full min.js reference it throws a wrench in my plans.  I have seen where I can probably hack the class selectors for date picker in the materialize.min.js but I'd rather not mess with the source if possible.  So I'm either looking for someone who has a materialize.chips.min.js standalone or a nice cleaner way to change the date picker init.
[2021-02-10 21:41:15] <doughballs> @shaney80you should be compiling a custom Materialize build for your projects, not including the default js. You comfortable using grunt? And Sass?
[2021-02-10 22:55:31] <shaney80> doughballs: I've been using Sass so I'm good on that side, but I've never used Grunt before.  I'm using .Net

[2021-02-12 07:18:58] <GerritKuilder> I found a piece of code for modal loading ajax: [<-LINK->] It uses leanModal, so you need to replace it with $('.modal-trigger').modal(); insteand of $('.modal-trigger').leanModal();
[2021-02-12 07:19:33] <GerritKuilder> Weird thing is the ajax conten only loads on teh second click....
[2021-02-12 07:35:01] <GerritKuilder> The second click ws my bad, bad copy/paste. It only works if you use 1 link, with 2 links it will find only the first data-source...
[2021-02-12 11:03:18] <GerritKuilder> ` $('.modal-trigger').click(function () {var $current = $(this);var url = $current.attr("data-source");// use other ajax submission type for post, put ...console.log(url)$.get(url, function (data) {//console.log(data)// use this method you need to handle the response from the view// with rails Server-Generated JavaScript Responses this is portion will be in a .js.erb file$(".modal-content").html(data);});});

[2021-02-21 06:19:46] <Zee98> hello dear all, I was wondering if there is an option for datepicker that show/list the year-rage in descending order. right now, i see that i can only specify the min and max year range. or the number selecting the year in future and past to show.
[2021-02-21 08:18:32] <doughballs> pauld0051: just trigger a click on the collapsible header that you need to be open. You could do with css too - inspect the element when open and add that to the one you want to remain open. Possibly a class of active or something like that.
[2021-02-21 08:20:00] <doughballs> Zee98: if you want a year picker, use a select element instead.
[2021-02-21 08:36:45] <Zee98> doughballs: i want the year range in the date picker.
[2021-02-21 08:51:16] <doughballs> Zee98: there is already a year range in the datepicker, but it is set to default to the current year and doesn’t look to be an option to change that.
[2021-02-21 09:17:41] <doughballs> But just thinking on this, if you absolutely need for the year to start at one end, you could just set the current date to be the last/first year of your range.
[2021-02-22 18:26:12] <bboatth> there is no class margin top like bootstrap ?

[2021-02-23 10:39:32] <doughballs> OjhaG2021: my advice would be to use autocomplete - or present the data in another way. Dropdowns are not ideal for really long lists of data, and there isn't an inbuilt search function for the select in materialize.

[2021-02-24 17:27:36] <tuffant21> So it says, nav should have a child ul. Ul should have a child li. li ul by itself would mean there is a ul as a child of li. When you hover on this li it should become visible
[2021-02-24 17:27:46] <tuffant21> <nav><ul><li><ul>this would become visible on hover</ul></li></ul></nav>
[2021-02-24 17:29:17] <tuffant21> Need more info
[2021-02-24 17:30:03] <bener07> nope thanks dude I'm grateful
[2021-02-24 20:13:28] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] Thank you :) This worked perfectly.

[2021-02-25 22:47:13] <pauld0051> Hello all. I am trying to put a search bar into my navbar, and so far it is all going a bit crud.
[2021-02-25 22:47:48] <pauld0051> The bar doesn't show when nothing in it, but when I go and type something, the label isn't disappearing.
[2021-02-25 22:50:07] <pauld0051> I am using backend for search so I have set it up like this:
[2021-02-25 22:50:10] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-25 22:50:42] <pauld0051> If someone has a nice, neat, Materialize search bar for the navbar, I would love to see it!
[2021-02-25 23:07:22] <Wondeys> Hi, is it possible to make the "Material Box" as "display: flex" and still have the right zoom effect?I try to make a gallery and I want the images to fit so I use flex, but if I then add the materialboxed class, the images are not showing properly and if I click on them it doesnt open right aswell.Thanks
[2021-02-26 07:13:18] <doughballs> pauld0051: Materialize already has the markup for a nav search. Check the nav page.
[2021-02-26 07:20:52] <doughballs> Wondeys: what do you mean ‘want them to fit?’ All the same height? I think I’ve had problems with this in the past.
[2021-02-26 19:55:15] <Wondeys> doughballs: Yep all the same height and so they fit inside the gallery perfectly
[2021-02-26 19:55:43] <Wondeys>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-26 19:56:01] <Wondeys> Thats how it should look like, but if I add the materialboxed class it looks like that
[2021-02-26 19:56:09] <Wondeys>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-26 20:00:30] <Wondeys> thats the code, hope it helps

[2021-02-26 20:00:36] <Wondeys>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-26 20:03:49] <Wondeys> aswell I tried to call the open method to just open the image when clicking on it, and close it if you click again, but thats not working properly too: [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-26 20:36:08] <doughballs> Wondeys: need a working demo really...
[2021-02-26 20:54:18] <doughballs> @Wondeys I realised, as I was building this, that I'd already built it before and got to the same point...!https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/JjbpaZZThis is my idea: set an image container with fixed height, fill it with image, but somehow set the height back to auto when it opens. Can't get it to work...
[2021-02-26 20:57:39] <doughballs> I wonder if you could put the image as a background image somehow. Don't have time to test right now...but one thing is for sure, using Mbox on a bunchy of differently sized images is not easy :D
[2021-02-26 22:51:17] <bener07> hi, i kind have an issue i did a header with an image and a contacts link to other page but the contacts tag doesn't want to stay on the other side of the header so if anyone could helpI will show the code and the output [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-26 23:07:43] <bener07>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-02-26 23:07:45] <bener07> the output is this
[2021-02-26 23:16:02] <bener07> the image is diferent of course
[2021-02-26 23:51:11] <Wondeys> doughballs: I found another solution, I cut each image and make it fit into the gallery. Its a lot of work, but it should work. Thanks for you help tho <3
[2021-03-02 18:53:06] <ManuTheCoder> Hi! I was wanting to make an extended floating action button thatexpands/contractson scroll
[2021-03-02 18:53:26] <ManuTheCoder> 
[2021-03-02 18:53:42] <ManuTheCoder> Here is my code so far:
[2021-03-02 18:53:47] <ManuTheCoder>  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-03-03 07:16:37] <doughballs> ManuTheCoder: when exactly do you need it to expand, and when to contract? There’s a snippet in the startup theme that turns a navbar solid from transparent. It’s transparent when the page it at the top of the viewport (0) and solid if anywhere below  (>0). Would this work?
[2021-03-03 10:50:54] <pauld0051> I'm having troubles with buttons over hanging on cards on mobile devices.
[2021-03-03 10:53:44] <bener07> can you give more help, or explain better?
[2021-03-03 10:54:03] <pauld0051> I am trying to add a screenshot.. haha, things going bad here for screenshots.
[2021-03-03 10:54:53] <bener07> ok
[2021-03-03 10:55:04] <pauld0051> Hmmm, how do I add a screenhot? I have done it before, seems odd.
[2021-03-03 10:56:42] <bener07> well if you take a screenshot with the pc, you can click on "windows" + "V" and the transference area shows up, this is on windows
[2021-03-03 10:57:00] <pauld0051> I am doing exactly that.
[2021-03-03 10:57:52] <bener07> or to take a screenshot you can click on "windows" + "Shift" + "S"
[2021-03-03 10:58:22] <pauld0051> I have the screen shot. I just can't add it here. Weird. I have done it plenty of times before.
[2021-03-03 10:58:51] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-03 10:59:01] <bener07> ok is here
[2021-03-03 10:59:17] <pauld0051> There... this way worked. Perhaps the others were too large? Well, there... the submit button over hangs.
[2021-03-03 10:59:29] <bener07> this is on a app or a website
[2021-03-03 11:00:05] <pauld0051> Webpage
[2021-03-03 11:00:05] <pauld0051>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-03 11:01:07] <bener07> well i think i can't do alot but waht are you having problems??
[2021-03-03 11:01:15] <pauld0051> Is it the extra "right" in the button?
[2021-03-03 11:01:39] <pauld0051> The submit button needs to fit within the white card, not overhang.
[2021-03-03 11:01:58] <bener07> ok let me see
[2021-03-03 11:02:35] <bener07> you can use an top property on the css code
[2021-03-03 11:11:25] <bener07> and basically the button is in a diferent  than the card I think
[2021-03-03 11:18:19] <pauld0051> When you say use the "top" property.... what exactly are you meaning?
[2021-03-03 11:20:40] <bener07> use some improve  like this [<-CODE->] 
[2021-03-03 11:22:09] <bener07> or<label class="waht you want" style="top: 20px;">
[2021-03-03 11:23:37] <pauld0051> Ahh, it's ok, I fixed it, it was correct the way I have it here.
[2021-03-03 11:24:07] <bener07> ok, i know i'm not the best to help
[2021-03-03 15:06:55] <ManuTheCoder> Basically, the fab should collapse while scrolling, and expand while scrollingup
[2021-03-03 15:08:06] <ManuTheCoder> Right now, scrolling just hides the FAB with a small animation using thescaleproperty
[2021-03-03 15:17:37] <ManuTheCoder> See: [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-03 17:15:37] <ElliotFer2000> Hello, I'm using materialize with react, I need a textfield only accept strings of 8 characters. I'm using data-length attribute but only marks error to users if I exceed the 8 characters but not when I type a string of a size lesser than 8
[2021-03-03 17:16:13] <ElliotFer2000> useEffect(()=>{const charCounter = new M.CharacterCounter(document.querySelector("#phone-number"))})
[2021-03-03 17:17:18] <ElliotFer2000> The other problem I see is, I'm using an Icon for the field but the color's icon doesn't change its color when the error is shown to the user
[2021-03-03 17:34:34] <ElliotFer2000> I've solved the problem, I've used the pattern attribute in the field  instead of data-length to throw the error message when the string is not of 8 characters.

[2021-03-03 20:03:14] <rogerdc> Hey, all. I'm using Selenium to try and grab the state of a switch element. The guide at https://materializecss.com/switches.html says this: [<-CODE->] But when I try and look at the DOM, I can't find any differences there when the switch is turned on or turned off. Anyone have any insight on how the DOM changes when a switch is turned on vs. off?
[2021-03-03 21:22:13] <jshster> roderdc you just need to look at the checked property of the checkbox.  I was able to replicate the behaviour you're seeing - in that whether you tick it or not, the "checked" attribute will still show in the inspect window BUT if you run some jQuery as follows - alert($(this).is(":checked")); - on the click of the checkbox you'll see that it does toggle.  Hope that helps.Additional note - Another approach if you're wanting to check the checked state is - $(this).prop('checked').  This also will change between true and false depending on whether the box is ticked or not.
[2021-03-03 21:33:17] <rogerdc> Thanks, jshster. Here's my final answer:
[2021-03-03 21:35:48] <rogerdc>  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-03-03 21:39:39] <rogerdc> The element is the span within the switch, since that is what registers clicks. So I go up a level and down to the input, and then grab its state.
[2021-03-03 21:40:12] <rogerdc> The highlight and unhighlight draw a pink outline around the element I'm interacting with so you can see what it is I'm doing.
[2021-03-04 09:26:00] <albcorare26> Hello, I have a problem and I don't know how to make my image occupy 100% of the screen width.

[2021-03-05 11:12:34] <bener07> i think if you use and .slidetoogle function it could work
[2021-03-05 11:13:27] <bener07> here you have an example
[2021-03-05 11:13:32] <bener07>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-05 11:14:46] <bener07> but can someone help me please
[2021-03-06 14:07:57] <doughballs> sisaha9: that is not good UX in my opinion. It is actually a little bit pointless if you thinking about it. But, you could use collapsible to get something similar. You would put a button inside the collapsible head, and change the styling to remove the lines etc.
[2021-03-06 14:09:22] <doughballs> bener07: what are you trying to do? Just copy the example from the docs and use the correct markup, then amend to fit your needs.
[2021-03-06 14:09:44] <doughballs> albcorare26: looks like your content is inside a container...
[2021-03-07 11:38:21] <turingoat> I have a problem with the menu for mobile devices. It opens but the items cannot be clicked. Can you tell me what's wrong with the code and how to fix it?Everything can be found here [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-07 14:38:55] <doughballs> turingoat: I’ve never had this issue but I’ve heard others have it. Check the z-index on the sidenav overlay.
[2021-03-08 20:27:01] <kjq221> Is it possible to add images inside modals? From how I have set up my modal at least, it does not seem to be the case, but I could be doing it wrong: codepen: [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-08 20:31:59] <doughballs> kjq221: no idea what’s going on in that codepen, but the short answer is: yes, you can put images inside modals. I would take the very basic modal example from the docs, and put an image inside it, and take it from there.
[2021-03-08 20:32:40] <kjq221> Yeah i don't know what happened there either. I just used a smaller image and it seems to display it now. Can the modal not display large resolution images?
[2021-03-08 20:32:48] <kjq221> the one I was using was around 2000x2000
[2021-03-08 20:45:28] <kjq221> So to add to my question since now I figured out how to get the image to load, is it possible to make it so the image takes up the full modal space and does not require a scroll bar?
[2021-03-08 20:56:19] <doughballs> kjq221: you need to put class of responsive-img to stop images spilling outside of their container.
[2021-03-08 20:59:11] <kjq221> I did and they still overflow
[2021-03-08 21:00:35] <doughballs> On the image itself? You can also try width:100% on the image.
[2021-03-08 21:01:01] <doughballs> Also no need to use 2000px wide, because modals will never be that wide.
[2021-03-08 21:01:23] <kjq221> I have it as <img class="responsive-img" src="img/IMG_4249.jpg" alt="">
[2021-03-08 21:13:27] <turingoat> doughballs: thank you, I will try
[2021-03-08 22:16:58] <kjq221> I have it as <img class="responsive-img" src="img/IMG_4249.jpg" alt="">It's a long vertical image I feel like I need to add. I know I can set a pixel limit, but that would cause the image to look bad.
[2021-03-09 01:25:25] <kjq221> Would setting the modal to be a max height be better?
[2021-03-09 09:31:18] <doughballs> kjq221: modal is not ideal for something like this. Meant for small bits of content that would ideally fit on any screen without needing to scroll.
[2021-03-09 18:01:10] <kjq221> doughballs: do you have any suggestions then? I tried the materialbox component but it cuts the text off for long captions which is why I transitioned into modals. On mobile it works really well with vertical images
[2021-03-09 18:32:04] <doughballs> kjq221: materialbox does sound like what you need. Can you control the size of the caption/style it so it doesn’t cut off? Reduce the length of the captions?

[2021-03-18 13:01:35] <doughballs> Ribbfors: card don’t use flex, Materialize uses a % and float based grid system. Put each card in a col and let the grid take care of stacking.
