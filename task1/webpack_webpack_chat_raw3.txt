[2021-01-04 11:44:31] <thw0rted> Your link is a 404 now
[2021-01-04 11:45:44] <thw0rted> If webpack is runningtsc(the Typescript compiler) and it's complaining about a.d.ts, that's weird.  If Webpack is saying "I don't have a loader defined for .d.ts files", that means something is trying torequirea .d.ts, which should never happen.
[2021-01-04 11:48:12] <thw0rted> I've had this problem when people have a broad Context defined, either viarequire.context(/too-many-files.*\.ts/), orrequire("/some/path/" + fileName).  Webpack will try to statically analyze the latter statement, and treat (more or less) asrequire.context(/\/some\/path\/.*/)
[2021-01-04 11:50:13] <thw0rted> Either way you wind up with it grabbing.d.tsfiles when it shouldn't.  If you can fix therequire/require.contextso it excludes the typings, do that.  If you can't, add a rule like{test: /\.d\.ts$/, use: "null-loader"}

[2021-01-06 18:14:36] <thw0rted> That's called minification or uglification.  Webpack should minify your code automatically when built in production mode.

[2021-01-07 20:44:53] <charvey77> Hello everyone,I'm still using webpack 4.28.4 for organizational reasons. We are trying to transpile some of our code to support ES5 using Babel 7, but our resulting bundle is throwing console errors when loaded in a browser (Chromium v44). We have seen some of the newer options available in webpack 5, which some of my colleagues have been able to use to resolve similar failures:output.environment.arrowFunction = false 
target = 'es5'Is there some sort of equivalent approach for webpack 4? Do we just need to find the right combination of Babel plugins to fully convert to ES5?The console error we get in Chromium 44 is always an "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )" in some low level Dojo JavaScript file which we know is unchanged and should be a valid function.Here's a cleaned up version of our webpack.config.js: [<-CODE->] 
[2021-01-08 09:16:41] <jantimon> Did you try to hardcoded it to44instead of usingbabel_chrome_level?
[2021-01-08 10:55:47] <thw0rted> In Chrome devtools, you might be able to get it to pretty-print the minified Dojo sources to better identify exactly which feature it's tripping over
[2021-01-08 10:58:11] <thw0rted> The better fix for this is to find whatever numbskull in your organization has you stuck on aFIVE YEAR OLDversion of a browser and smack them until they stop
[2021-01-08 11:00:03] <thw0rted> Also it looks like you're explicitly excludingdojofrom your Babel transform
[2021-01-08 11:04:55] <thw0rted> I don't know much about Dojo -- I guess they made a totally new "modern" version at some point? -- but maybe you can pin to an older version of it that officially supports your version of Chrome?

[2021-01-11 10:12:23] <thw0rted> Roland, does your project run in Node or in the browser?
[2021-01-11 10:13:20] <thw0rted> If browser, then I need more context around the error, because I don't understand what's causing it
[2021-01-11 10:13:40] <thw0rted> If your code runs in Node, use thefspackage to interact with the file system
[2021-01-11 10:14:08] <thw0rted> (And for that matter, why use Webpack in the first place? Node code doesn't need to be bundled.)
[2021-01-11 10:14:46] <thw0rted> Anyway it would be helpful to post a small reproduction somewhere and link to that
[2021-01-11 10:25:09] <Rolanddoda> It runs on the browser, I have a vue.js app
[2021-01-11 10:26:12] <Rolanddoda> I am trying to auto-import routes from the folder structure and this is my code: [<-CODE->] 
[2021-01-11 10:31:03] <Rolanddoda> The code above works fine if I remove the type: module from the package.json but if I add it I get the warning.FYI the vue-router package expects an array of objects which define the SPA routes. Instead of adding routes manually, I try withrequire.context()to get those routes automatically by using a folder structure.
[2021-01-11 10:33:47] <Rolanddoda> I searched this a bit and it seems that it's not possible to do what I want (at least without hacking around with node file system) by using ES modules for 2 reasons.1) Haven't found an import alternative to require.context()2) import() it asynchronous which will make my code fail because vue-router doesn't waits. Could be workarounds to make it wait though, but too hacky.So right now, I will stick with removing "type": "module" from package.json
[2021-01-11 11:37:31] <thw0rted> I'm not sure how to configure Vue's router for asynchronous loading butimport()is the correct way to feed it modules.  These are the relevant Webpack docs: [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-11 11:38:08] <thw0rted> And this is where to start for Vue, I think [<-LINK->] 
[2021-01-11 11:39:02] <thw0rted> If you userequire.context()then Webpack is going to put every matching file in your bundle.  Dynamicimport()lets you split off separate entry points per route, reducing the initial bundle size
[2021-01-11 11:40:25] <thw0rted> Using Promise-based (import()) lazy loading in your Vue router isn't "hacky", it's the way it's supposed to be used in modern browsers
[2021-01-11 11:42:09] <thw0rted> That said, you have to look at your use case.  If your whole site is 5MB but your front page can fit in 20k, splitting will really improve user experience.  If your front page needs 90% of your dependencies, nobody will notice the difference
[2021-01-11 11:50:47] <rickihastings> Hey, I seem to be having a problem with Module Federation and material-ui that I'm wondering if anyone else has came across. We have quite a large app which is being split up into a container and various micro-frontends. The container has material-ui components a long with the ThemeProvider etc. The micro-frontends are also using material-ui components, we've added all the@material-ui/*libraries to the shared object in both apps, but it seems like multiple parts of material-ui are being loaded from either the container or the sub apps and we can't seem to force any consistency, we'd just like the container to provide the entire of material-ui. It's resulting in inconsistent import orders and duplicate<style>tags etc. We've tried supplyingexternalsand also forcing all the packages into a chunk and neither work.
[2021-01-11 12:31:56] <Rolanddoda>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] and the route.js has this code: [<-CODE->] So my auto-routing code just takes this object and puts it into routes array vue-router expects.Lazy-loading will still work
[2021-01-11 12:38:13] <Rolanddoda> Here is the array of objects my auto-routing code generates. As you can see the component it's a function which means it's not loaded.
[2021-01-11 12:39:35] <Rolanddoda> So to bring up my case again.Everything works, but using ES modules gives me an warning on this file
[2021-01-11 13:07:23] <Rolanddoda> Actually, I just tested it, and you are right,no lazy-loading happenswith my auto-routing code. I wonder why :/. I just tried to automatically populate the routes. Hmm
[2021-01-11 13:22:14] <Rolanddoda> Does webpack auto loads thiscomponent: () => import('./component-path')?

So when I ran webpack withyarn webpack;yarn serve buildeverything worked fine. I wanted to use the webpack dev server so after setting it up I ran 'webpack serve' but it wasn't attaching my library to window.<library>. After googling a lot and trying different thing I ran 'webpack serve --help' and noticed the --target switch. So then when I ranwebpack serve --target webeverything works as expected.
[2021-01-15 15:57:43] <Enome> Is that --target switch documented anywhere?

[2021-01-21 15:30:18] <thw0rted> I think this is whathtml-webpack-plugindoes, specifically with theinject: trueoption.  You don't write thescripttag yourself, they're generated and injected in the template you configure

[2021-01-27 11:53:50] <thw0rted> That's because you're packaging it as UMD.  What you want to do is called "tree shaking" (excluding unused code) and it's only possible when the code you're importing is packaged as an ES6 module
[2021-01-27 11:54:25] <thw0rted> I think also you might need to do individual imports, i.e.import {MyClass} from "/path/to/my_lib"
[2021-01-27 11:55:02] <rtalon83> But, I want to write LIB.MyClass
[2021-01-27 11:56:31] <thw0rted> Scratch that second part, my guess was wrong: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2021-01-27 11:57:04] <thw0rted> But I'm pretty sure you still need your library to be ES6 modules
[2021-01-27 11:57:08] <thw0rted> not UMD
[2021-01-27 11:57:24] <thw0rted> you probably shouldn't need webpack to build your library in the first place
[2021-01-27 11:57:31] <thw0rted> justtsc
[2021-01-27 11:57:56] <rtalon83> or rollup
[2021-01-27 11:58:02] <rtalon83> instead of webpack

[2021-01-28 11:43:22] <thw0rted> I'm not sure it will fix your issue but you should change tomaterial-design-icons-iconfont, thematerial-design-iconspackage is intended for people who want to build their own fonts from sources
[2021-01-28 11:43:40] <thw0rted> it's not really kept up to date and is an order of magnitude larger
[2021-01-28 11:45:33] <thw0rted> You have tworulesfor each font type, I'm not sure what happens when two rules match the same file.  (First one wins maybe?)
[2021-01-28 11:51:53] <thw0rted> If you're considering a move to webpack v5, you can convert to asset modules.  My font rules look like [<-CODE->] 
[2021-01-28 11:54:20] <thw0rted> Well, that means your images are a lot more than 8kb each, so as I said in the channel you must not have alimitset on yoururl-loader.  If moving to v5 is an option, you can just change to asset modules and get sane defaults for free

[2021-01-31 13:05:49] <happybeing> I'm having an issue with thewebpack-dev-middleware. Is there a way to get it to serve resources from disk which it is not emitting itself? For example I have./dist/wasm/somefile.wasmbut it gives a 404 for this. The samewebpack.config.jsworks with thewebpack-dev-serverCLI though so I assume this should be possible.
[2021-01-31 13:17:25] <happybeing> I also have my own./dist/index.htmlwhich I'd rather use than one created by theHtmlWebpackPluginplugin, but that's less of an issue.
[2021-01-31 17:15:35] <happybeing> ^^ I've figured this out. Solution is that I needed to instruct theexpressmiddleware I'm using to serve the static assets: [<-CODE->] 
[2021-01-31 20:14:01] <Spence-S> Does anyone here know if you can use the new asset modules inline like you could with say raw loader? like...require('raw-loader!whatever.svg')
[2021-02-01 10:08:12] <thw0rted> Spencer: [<-LINK->] gives a good overview
[2021-02-01 10:08:23] <thw0rted> "asset/source exports the source code of the asset. Previously achievable by using raw-loader."
[2021-02-01 10:15:20] <thw0rted> Re-reading the question, it looks like you're trying to find override syntax, so you could e.g. configuresvgastype: assetnormally, but in one specific case,requirethe raw content instead.  Is that right?  If so, I haven't seen a way to do that, so it might be worth opening an issue

[2021-02-04 10:59:12] <raphael10-collab> Hi all,
[2021-02-04 11:00:46] <raphael10-collab> As you can see from here: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3508#issuecomment-772772507 and from here: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3508#issuecomment-773151528 I have this situation:This is the package.json [<-CODE->] When using ipfs in main.ts I get this error: [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-04 11:01:33] <raphael10-collab> People of IPFS Project made, kindly,  thoughrough analysis of the problem, discovering that there is a collision between two versions of jsonfile:There are two copies of jsonfile in my node_modules folder: [<-CODE->] I removed all the packages not stricly required for ipfs and for a bare minimum electron-react-typescript app.And discovered that, in accordance what was already found by IPFS's people,these are the modules which depend on jsonfile : [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-04 11:01:47] <raphael10-collab> If I remove the jsonfile v4 I get the error: "An unhandled exception has occured inside Forge": [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-04 11:02:19] <raphael10-collab> In a nutshell the problem is that electron-forge uses the version 4 of jsonfile, while Ipfs uses version 6 of jsonfile. And webpack loads the version 4.

[2021-02-04 15:42:06] <mdix> I know that webpack 5 stopped to expose process.env to the bundle. I need to use it anyway as we have libraries that I can't adapt. Therefore, I decided to manually define process.env like suggested in the webpack 5 configuration. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-04 16:16:38] <mdix> Is there some setting or something that tells webpack about my target? Like, if I build for node, I don't need to inline process.env, but if I build for browser, I would like to...
[2021-02-04 16:25:35] <mdix> Gosh, I got it... so, if you define the plugins like above (as strings), webpack won't expose a "process" object, but just replace the ocurrences of "process.env.NODE_ENV". So, if you want to have a process object in your output, you need to completely redefine process. In my opinion the WARNING of this page is wrong: https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/. Now, that webpack does no longer expose process to the build, if you wan't to have process in the build, you need to define it the way they say is not safe. [<-CODE->] Holy cow... 3 hours... :-(

[2021-02-05 10:30:42] <thw0rted> From what I understand, the Webpack team's position is that either all your dependencies should configure theirexportsfield to explicitly specify exactly what to provide, correctly (using conditionals, etc), or you as the consumer can setresolve.exportsFields: []and ignoreexportscompletely

[2021-02-10 13:19:14] <thw0rted> I upgraded to Webpack 5 a few weeks ago, and so instead of runningwebpack-dev-serverat the command line I'm runningwebpack serve.  This came with some changes towatchOptions, etc.  One thing that bothers me is that before, when I changed a source file, the dev server console immediately printed something like "file xyz changed, building..." (I can't remember the actual message), but now withwebpack serve, the build kicks off without printing anything until it's basically done, so I don't actually know that it noticed the change
[2021-02-10 13:20:33] <thw0rted> My app is pretty big so a rebuild takes about 20 seconds, which is a long time to wait to see if it's actually building.  The thing is, I don't even know exactly where that message I remember came from, so I'm not sure where to look for a config option to get it to show up again (or who to file an issue with to add it as a feature under the new way of doing things)

[2021-02-14 09:03:29] <Booster2ooo> Hello, I'm developping for Angular (if that matters :)) and I was wondering how to dynamically load modules at runtime. I thought Module Federation would be an option but it still seems a bit "static" from my (poor) understanding. Maybe you might enlighten me, here is the conceptual use case: an "infra team" builds and deploys a "dummy" app shell. This app shell only knows a "module registry" concept, it doesn't know about any other modules. There are other teams, A, B and C, that dev their modules on their own and publish the said modules in the "module registry". At runtime, the use access the app shell. He can choose "I want to use module A and module C but not module B". Tomorrow, team D arrives with its module and publish it. Without recompiling app shell, the user now have the possibility to load module D if he wants to. Could this scenario be covered by MF (or any other webpack feature) and if so, how? If not, would you have any suggestion ?

use modernizr-loader - no success here at all
use webpack-modernizr-loader - and this oneactually 2 and 3 i just do not understand, the documentation is pretty pure for me.so, is there a way to ship modernizr in default template of html-webpack-plugin?or is there some working setups with loaders?

Hmm, if I comment that out, next it complains aboutpublicPath: '/'... so it looks like a problem somehow related to webpack-dev-middleware. Do I need to explicitly reference that now, somehow?

[2021-02-18 22:28:09] <strarsis> I want to move an emitted file into a specific folder. The webpack copy plugin can copy the emitted files to the intended folder, however, the files also still go to their original destinations.
[2021-02-18 22:28:45] <strarsis> Is there a move/mv/rename webpack plugin? Or a skip emit plugin so I can filter out the emitted original files and only keep the copied ones?
[2021-02-18 22:28:47] <strarsis> thanks
[2021-02-18 22:45:43] <strarsis> Hm, in gulp one would just stream the emitted file to another target.
[2021-02-18 22:57:46] <robertmain> Hey folks. I'm using webpack5.The following POC: [<-CODE->] Produces:> webpackwebpack: Starting Build command: A webpack error occured while building: use --log-level=debug for more error detail command: Cannot read property 'tap' of undefined
[2021-02-18 22:58:35] <robertmain> Is there a move/mv/rename webpack plugin? Or a skip emit plugin so I can filter out the emitted original files and only keep the copied ones? [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-18 23:12:59] <strarsis> robertmain: : The loader would be the thing that uses the actual emitted files, right? In this case the loader is a PostCSS plugin, PostCSS itself is used as a webpack plugin. How can I access the actual loader?
[2021-02-18 23:24:28] <strarsis> Is there a webpack loader for converting TTF to WOFF/WOFF2?
[2021-02-18 23:24:37] <strarsis> that would be the actual way to use it
[2021-02-18 23:39:03] <robertmain> strarsis: the loader would be the thing insidemodule.rules
[2021-02-18 23:39:55] <robertmain> and no, I'm not aware of a loader that converts TTF to WOFF. That's not really what webpack is for.

[2021-02-19 10:09:17] <thw0rted> Re: converting fonts, it would be wasteful to do that on every build.  Packages like@fontsourcegenerally ship all the popular formats, then you can just import the main CSS for the font and the style loader will add the fonts as assets.   If you're using Webpack 5 asset modules, you can pick where the file winds up like this: [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-19 10:11:50] <eskydar> Hey,I am wondering gif someone could point me into the right direction. I am currently building an app in react using Scandit for barcode scanning and scandit requires a engineLocation which by their example they get from their CDN. We do not want external calls and we have the engine in our node_modules folder. Would it somehow be an option for me to make this accessible at some location using webpack. (can deliver code examples of course if required)
[2021-02-19 10:19:41] <thw0rted> It sounds like maybe you want to usecopy-webpack-plugin
[2021-02-19 10:21:16] <thw0rted>  [<-LINK->] -- you tell it where the asset ("engine"?) is in the filesystem, and during the build it will copy the file(s) to the output directory.  Then in your code, you tell the library a relative path where it got copied
[2021-02-19 10:25:07] <eskydar> I think that is exactly what I am looking for!
[2021-02-19 10:25:08] <eskydar> thanks
[2021-02-19 10:25:33] <thw0rted> A simple config would look likeplugins: [ new CopyPlugin({from: "node_modules/scandit/engine", to: "Assets/scandit_engine"}) ]. That copies theenginedirectory into./dist/Assets/scandit_engine, then you can tell the libraryscandit.setup("./Assets/scandit_engine/data.json")or whatever
[2021-02-19 10:54:40] <eskydar> Although, it doesn't seem to be working but thats for me to figure out
[2021-02-19 10:54:41] <eskydar> Thanks

[2021-02-19 12:13:28] <bbepis> is it possible to rename the "main" chunk to something else? since i have this to generate .map files, and it always creates "main.js.map" instead of "addon.js.map" as i create through output.filename [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-19 12:15:20] <bbepis> normally i'd usedevtool: 'source-map',but i don't want a mapping to be created for the vendor file
[2021-02-19 12:43:40] <krutoo> Hi to all. How can i log webpack work result when using Node API exactly same as with CLI (colored text in terminal)?There is some kind of default callback forwebpack(options, callback)?
[2021-02-19 14:33:26] <thw0rted> bbepis: that's interesting, I've never tried to customize sourcemaps like that.  Seems like an issue with that plugin?  One thing you could try, if you're not already, is to configureoptimization.minimizerusing theTerserPlugin, to exclude node_modules from minification
[2021-02-19 14:33:35] <thw0rted> Because if it's not getting minified in the first place it shouldn't have sourcemaps
[2021-02-19 14:33:45] <thw0rted> (just usingdevtool: 'source-map'or whatever)
[2021-02-19 14:36:19] <thw0rted> actually it's kind of bonkers that the default config does not appear to exclude node_modules -- I don't want to re-minify all my dang dependencies on every build, they should be exposing pre-minified sources via their package file in the first place
[2021-02-19 15:42:45] <bbepis> @thw0rted i actually ended up getting that sorted out by changing the entry property to this: [<-CODE->] before i was just specifying a string, so it was just inferring it as "main"
[2021-02-19 15:43:06] <bbepis> as for minification being disabled and stuff, it's just all out of whack because i was playing around with it
[2021-02-19 15:44:15] <bbepis> thanks for the help though, you're doing a public service helping people here
[2021-02-19 16:13:19] <thw0rted> You're quite welcome, I actually came to ask for help and just stayed because I learn from watching what other people do with webpack
[2021-02-19 16:14:23] <thw0rted> I'm a lot more productive because of webpack but of all the tools in my figurative toolbox, it still feels like the one with the most "magic", or at least the one that I have the hardest time debugging when it doesn't do what I expected

[2021-02-20 16:50:20] <dtabuenc> Why are there 4 different ones with different hashes? Is that normal?
[2021-02-20 18:40:12] <dtabuenc> Nevermind, I think I understand after stepping through the code. If you don't specify a specific version in your "share"  then it will infer version ranges from every module that consumes  it (including third-party modules in node_modules) by looing in their package.json
[2021-02-21 16:50:38] <cjblomqvist> A) [<-LINK->] says to clear cache on npm postinstall. How do you clear the persistent cache? Is there a command or are we simply talking about manually removing all files (assuming filesystem cache type) using something like 'rm -R <location of webpack persistent cache>'?B) Why is this really needed? From [<-LINK->] is seems like webpack is able to detect changes through package.json fields (specifically version) of all components. Then doesn't this mean that in all normal scenarios it will already be handled?
[2021-02-21 19:01:53] <cjblomqvist> C) Does persistent cache not work with webpack-dev-middleware / webpack-hot-middleware ?

[2021-02-23 23:10:22] <b-e-r-t-o> Hello, I was wondering if anyone would have some insight on this as I have not been able to find a solution. Basically, I'm trying to see if it is possible to strip out a variable (along with any imports it references) from the file it's in into a separate file? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-24 04:38:17] <dotnetshadow>  [<-CODE->] So I removed the package from my package.json file, but when I go to run my webpack it says that the module cannot be found. I'm trying to customize using [<-CODE->] Any ideas?

[2021-02-25 01:27:30] <samhuk> Is anyone else having problems with no page reloading with webpack-dev-middleware + webpack-hot-middleware + react, after updating all to latest versions? I'm getting the above error about unaccepted modules and nothing to update. It worked with old versions of each, but since updating, it stopped. I can't find anything in the docs about this...
[2021-02-25 09:45:36] <samhuk> Ah, for the above, it is a known issue for a few months guys. Issue [<-ISSUE->] .

[2021-02-25 12:32:48] <elisabetperez> Hey guys! I'm having trouble with html-loader and static-i18n. When I run the building command html-loader processes everything correctly (css, Js and images processed), but when I execute i18n (before or after the build, the output does not change) , the output html source has no mention to any CSS or any JS scripts. It's like static-i18n is not compatible with html-loader and I can't find any loaders for this. Has somebody else experienced this issue?Just in case, let me add my webpack.common.js [<-CODE->] and this is my package.json and its commands: [<-CODE->] Thanks in advance!
[2021-02-25 14:02:00] <raphael10-collab> I have a questoin somewhat similar to what asked by @elisabetperez . How to include during webpack's build phase of an electron-react-typescript-webpack app python and C scripts? The objective is to copy the python files and the C executables in the correct sub-folders.In package.json I have :
[2021-02-25 14:03:31] <raphael10-collab>  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-25 14:03:48] <raphael10-collab> I also included in webpack.config.js's rules and CopyPlugin:
[2021-02-25 14:03:58] <raphael10-collab>  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-25 14:04:58] <raphael10-collab> But this doesn't work .  Manually copying the file, makes it work. But it's not a "solution"...
[2021-02-25 14:18:13] <raphael10-collab> Is there someone who can explain us how to copy folders intact to th webpack compiled folder?
[2021-02-25 16:11:43] <thw0rted> When you say the above "doesn't work", you mean like nothing happens?  Because that looks more or less right
[2021-02-25 16:15:59] <thw0rted> You don't need a wildcard infrom, justfrom: path.resolve("./src/whatever")or evenfrom: "./src/whatever", and I use relative paths forto, liketo: "Assets/Images"copies stuff from thefromdirectory into./dist/Assets/Images
[2021-02-25 16:16:41] <thw0rted> you might just need to take out all the asterisks
[2021-02-25 16:48:15] <raphael10-collab> Hi@thw0rted! Thank you for giving an hand. With :
[2021-02-25 16:50:38] <raphael10-collab>  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-25 16:51:05] <raphael10-collab> It actually copies the .py file :
[2021-02-25 16:51:19] <raphael10-collab>  [<-CODE->] 
[2021-02-25 16:52:31] <raphael10-collab> But the execution of the app doesn't produce any output, which is strange
[2021-02-25 16:58:05] <raphael10-collab> If I comment all the CopyPlugin code of webpack.config.js , executetype-check (tsc -w)and then manually copy the python file withcp -i src/scripts/python/factorial.py dist/scripts/python/then,  when I executenpx webpack --config ./webpack.config.jsI get the correct output:

[2021-02-25 21:17:04] <Cavmpt> Hi i have some webpack questions if that okay
[2021-02-25 21:17:35] <Cavmpt> With webpack you can specify eslint loaders prettier loaders and other things like that
[2021-02-25 21:18:59] <Cavmpt> what would be the purpose of those loaders as we could use eslint in the root of our project and webpack outputs the uglified code
[2021-02-25 23:54:21] <user72349823> Hi! Despite hours of Googling, Stack Overflow, etc, I can't find anyone else who has had this issue.A bit of background: Previously, we were using jasmine, karma, webpack v4, and karma-webpack to use webpack as a preprocessor, all without issue. To be honest, our tests are a bit of a mess—in many files ES6 imports and global state are overwritten with spies which aren't cleaned up, which occasionally caused issues where tests would fail because of spies which were leftover from tests which ran earlier. But regardless of this, everything was working and tests were running in an order such that they were passing.Cue upgrades to webpack v5 and karma-webpack v5. After upgrading both packages, about half of our 5,000 tests fail for various reasons, but most because of the reason I mentioned above: a lot of "already spied on" errors from previous files and within files (if spied are defined in multiple describe blocks).I've been able to gather that some of this is because webpack v5 causes tests to run in a different order (therefore surfacing some of the run order dependencies which already existed). But randomizing test order using webpack v4 results in ~100 failures (slightly different on each run, obviously), while with webpack v5 it's ~2,500 failures, so there must be something else going on. Has something changed with the way webpack handles imported modules from v4 -> v5? Perhaps it caches differently than in previous versions?Any suggestions on what's going on are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. I'm pulling my hair out here!
[2021-02-26 10:10:27] <thw0rted> The idea behind webpack is that all the build steps needed for your application are orchestrated with one tool, based on a single config
[2021-02-26 10:12:14] <thw0rted> that said I don't know why you'd want to run eslint or prettier in a loader, that doesn't sound like part of a build process to me
[2021-02-26 10:13:07] <thw0rted> I'm a bit confused what you mean about "uglified code", eslint does not uglify / minify / compress code
[2021-02-26 10:23:11] <thw0rted> I also use jasmine/karma/karma-webpack, and recently migrated from v4 to v5.  I rarely have to spy on module members so I haven't run into the behavior you're describing.  Have you tried using before/after hooks to clean up the spied-on stuff at the spec level?  (afterAll(() => { myModule.foo.and.callThrough(); myModule.bar.and.returnValue(originalBar); }, etc)
[2021-02-26 10:26:20] <thw0rted> If something major changed, it seems more likely to have been on the karma-webpack side than something with Webpack itself.  Just to confirm, you're using CJS modules for your test build, right?  Modifying "real" ES6 modules like this isn't supposed to work, AFAIK.
[2021-02-26 15:22:10] <deanc> How does theasset/resourceloader work exactly in webpack 5. I have a file inside my src directory calledapp.jswhich importsapp.csswhich references a font using absolute path. But there is no concept of absolute path here, and in fact the fonts themselves live OUTSIDE thesrc/dir inside a directory calledstatic/. I saw the existing webpack config i inherited is using some copy webpack plugin which copies thestaticdir to the output directory. Do the steps happen in synchronous way so that once the copy is done, that when the asset/resource loader encounters my font file with the absolute path of /files that it will look int he configured output directory and it should be there?
[2021-02-26 15:46:16] <user72349823> Hello, thanks for the reply! I did start to clean up spies as you described, since the issue is ultimately with how the tests themselves are written. It does fix the failures, although it's slow work. I guess I'm mostly wondering why the upgrade caused the issues to surface all at once. Thanks for the tip, I'll check with karma-webpack to see if they are aware of any changes.
[2021-02-27 07:47:47] <taburetkin> i am using relative path and also i have file-loader with rule for fonts.
[2021-02-28 00:47:43] <fivethreeo> Looking for suggestions on how make a plugin that works with hmr that can react to yarn workspace packages being rebuilt. I want to use a watching build on a package and in another process run a webpack-dev-server that autoreloads when the package being watched is compiled. Would it be enough to just add it to the compilers dependencies? Or do I somehow need the dependencies to be added to whichever module imports the dependency.
[2021-02-28 04:55:02] <Devinora> guys, tell me a stable build that runs webpack-dev-server

[2021-02-28 16:58:05] <fivethreeo> baruchyochai: you need to provide us more info/ setup a minimal example or show us your webpack setup
[2021-02-28 20:36:41] <fivethreeo> baruchyochai: I know what it is, you cannot use style-loader server side.

[2021-03-01 13:02:42] <fivethreeo> Find the loader like this: [<-LINK->] just use style-loader instead, and remove it.. or switch to razzle :)
[2021-03-01 13:26:22] <baruchyochai> fivethreeo: Razzle is relatively new and still not so popular. So, I do not know if it's better to use Razzle))

[2021-03-01 13:37:26] <baruchyochai> Also, we used isomorphic-style-loaderBUT it generated another error with Antd (ant design)

[2021-03-01 13:40:59] <baruchyochai> Then we did what is mentioned here in the comment under solution [<-LINK->] and it also led to the errors
[2021-03-01 15:29:48] <baruchyochai> We also tried these loaderscss-loader, sass loader and style-loader
[2021-03-01 15:48:25] <baruchyochai> here is more details: [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-01 16:23:11] <fivethreeo> I made a example with bleeding edge razzle [<-LINK->] - you could probably do this in rewire aswwll, look in razzle.config.js for the antd regex amt the less configuration
[2021-03-01 16:35:32] <fivethreeo> Devinora: all should work
[2021-03-01 16:56:23] <malloy045>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] It fills in the entry point name fine when doing a plain webpack build, this only happens when using dev server.Here is the relevant part of my config: [<-CODE->] 
[2021-03-01 17:04:05] <thw0rted> You can basically omitoptimizationcompletely when in dev, the defaults are kinda-sorta-fine
[2021-03-01 17:05:01] <thw0rted> you only need it if you're debugging something specific to the way Webpack is chunking your stuff
[2021-03-01 17:13:37] <malloy045>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] The last line is interesting.  Makes me wonder if the entrypoint name is null?  I tried defining it in the config, but I get the same results. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] This ultimately isn't a big deal, but it's annoying seeing null somewhere it shouldn't be.
[2021-03-01 17:20:38] <baruchyochai> Do you recommend Razzle? Does it have strong advantages? Just don't want to use additional frameworks such as nextjs only because of SSR...which will lead to additional maintenance and heavy app
[2021-03-01 17:26:21] <fivethreeo> Razzle is really agnostic as to what you use. I am the maintainer of Razzle. Razzle just handles the building. Everyhing else is up to you.
[2021-03-01 17:28:08] <fivethreeo> I would recommend it :)
[2021-03-01 17:49:10] <malloy045> Update on the message above.  I fixed it:use a static filename in the output config section
remove the optimization piece when using webpack-dev-server along@thw0rted, thanks for your help!
[2021-03-01 17:55:06] <baruchyochai> haha)) Thank you will try to implement based on the code that you sent. Let's see what happens
[2021-03-01 17:58:04] <fivethreeo> See here aswell to see how razzle does it here: [<-LINK->]

[2021-03-01 18:03:33] <baruchyochai> I really not so interested in using razzle, but I feel that I am forced to because of situation))
[2021-03-01 18:05:53] <baruchyochai> why do you recommend less instead of typescript
[2021-03-01 18:14:19] <fivethreeo> I am releasing 4.0 today, Razzle 4.0 works without that plugin for typescript. Instead of less? You mean babel instead if ts-loader?
[2021-03-01 18:16:02] <fivethreeo> you just need MiniCSSExtractPlugin/loader / less-loader / css-loader
[2021-03-01 18:22:38] <baruchyochai> Ok, we'll wait until you will release Razzle 4.0
[2021-03-01 21:13:08] <fivethreeo>  [<-LINK->] - watch this for when release happens
[2021-03-02 00:47:37] <monokrome> Does anyone know what the proper way is to directly assign the exports from a source file to the exported module from webpack? Like, to never export the object with a namespace. The docs say to set library to empty string, but doing that yieldsconfiguration.output.library should be an non-empty string.while a GitHub issue says that is a documentation bug and not an implementation bug
[2021-03-02 00:48:27] <monokrome> when I require my module in node, it exports{ mymodule: { ... } }instead of just{ ... }
[2021-03-02 00:51:20] <monokrome> I thought if I just set llibraryTarget to "commonjs", it'd work as expected - but it adds a weird namespace

[2021-03-02 00:52:12] <monokrome> uh?...
[2021-03-02 00:55:59] <monokrome> like ifindex.jsis justmodule.exports = 12
[2021-03-02 00:56:34] <monokrome> how do I get it to outputmodule.exports = 12instead ofmodule.exports = { mylibrary: 12 }
[2021-03-02 02:30:02] <fivethreeo> monokrome: webpack 4 or 5?
[2021-03-02 08:11:08] <baruchyochai> Thanks. But, I see that you started to talk there about canary 4.0.1 and what's about razzly 4.0 still not released
[2021-03-02 11:46:29] <kks773711_twitter> 2
[2021-03-02 13:11:51] <fivethreeo> 4.0.1-canary.2  is a prerelease, to ensure that 4.0 is perfect, need to have people verify my fix
[2021-03-02 13:14:13] <fivethreeo> 4.0.1-canary.2  will probably become 4.0.1
[2021-03-02 14:36:50] <elisabetperez> has anyone tried html-webpack-plugin and static-i18n together? it's acting up for me, like if they had conflicts and the html output isn't what it should be
[2021-03-02 15:12:18] <fivethreeo> elisabetperez: don't think they will work together at all
[2021-03-02 15:43:58] <baruchyochai> So, when you are going to release razzle 4.0.1?
[2021-03-02 15:46:11] <elisabetperez> fivethreeo: any workaround in mind?
[2021-03-02 15:47:44] <fivethreeo> Hopefully tomorrow, waiting for the one who reported the error i fixed to confirm it is fixed.
[2021-03-02 15:48:47] <fivethreeo> run it thru webpack twice is the only way i see
[2021-03-02 15:51:22] <elisabetperez> fivethreeo: then the dynamic vars or data-t from the json are not rendered in the html  it's like html webpack plugin adds the css and the js to my html and does not render the locales and i18n renders the data from the locales but removed the css and js. Never ending story!
[2021-03-02 16:04:28] <fivethreeo> maybe do a custom loader

(very similar to mini-css-extract-plugin)Just to explain my reasoning, I want my translations to be next to my components and coupled via import(to avoid bundling/sending translation json that's not currently being used)But, I still want to load them when my application starts (and not in a by component way, which is somewhat suggested in surviveJs ( [<-LINK->] ))I want to make a poc on how to keep translations near the component that consumes it... has anyone seen something similar out there?

[2021-03-02 21:11:46] <hponde_gitlab> When I addedesnextinto thelibfield oftsconfig.jsonI didn't need to add any import to getWeakRefto work. But I assume your questions points to the fact that I might need some explicit import?

[2021-03-02 21:14:03] <hponde_gitlab> I don't have any explicit import for it as of now. Nor could I find any good solution online. It seems to be part of the standard if you link withesnext? Which is what I'm unable to do withwebpackcurrently

[2021-03-03 17:23:54] <mkamalkayani> The Error says "cannot resolve Components/theme.scss". So it seems the webpack is not configured to compile .scss files. To convert .scss to css you have to use sass-loader. [<-LINK->]

[2021-03-05 08:50:23] <thw0rted> How sure are you that your ts-loader is reading the tsconfig file where you changedlib?
[2021-03-05 08:53:21] <thw0rted> If the error comes from ts-loader then it's not a webpack problem, it's a loader config problem, and it sounds likelibisn't being respected

[2021-03-08 01:47:04] <skoblenick> Hey all. Looking for some direction as to what I am doing wrong, or if this is a bug in the loaders. I have an experimental repo where I have been looking at webpack 5, mainly around using an html file as the entry rather than a js file. The repo is here [<-LINK->] . The html file contains script tag with a src/href to a js file, but it always generates `src="[Object object]". I am expecting it to use the js loader  to bundled and extract into a file like with other assets. What am I missing here?
[2021-03-08 09:10:21] <thw0rted> The examples I've seen generally have JS entry points and use html-loader to inject the bundle.  What benefit are you looking for from changing that?  (I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I just haven't seen people try to use it this way)
[2021-03-08 09:12:07] <thw0rted>  [<-CODE->] When evaluating the source code, it provides a fake context which was especially designed to cope with the code generated by the html- or the css-loader. Thus it might not work in other situations
[2021-03-08 09:12:40] <thw0rted> So usingextract-loaderto "extract" JS sounds like it might not work.  (Also, again, why?)
[2021-03-08 12:32:23] <randyr:matrix.org> I wrote a plugin for webpack5 that adds an asset. How comecompilation.emitAsset(filename, new RawSource(source));doesn't add a contenthash based on output.filename?
[2021-03-09 08:59:59] <valentin9> Hey guys/girls!anyone has experience porting from webpack 3 to 4/5 with manually picked vendor file?

[2021-03-09 23:18:20] <internetofsteve> Hello peeps,  I think the documentation for splitChunks.chunks is showing incorrect default value of "async" because it looks like the default value is "all" in the source code?https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#splitchunkschunkshttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/SplitChunksPlugin.js#L388

[2021-03-10 13:16:12] <liviuba> hi, I'm trying to use a library (three.js) and compiling my code with webpack, but I would like webpack to build just three.js separately (out of my .node_modules) and use it in my code like an 'external', but from a cacheable file on my server, not from a CDN link. Is there any general way to do this?
[2021-03-10 13:17:36] <liviuba> actually, ideally, I would like to disable bundling completely for development, so that I can add the cache headers that I need for any dependency
[2021-03-10 14:21:04] <thw0rted> If you're trying to twiddle cache headers you're probably overthinking it -- have you triedwebpack-dev-server?
[2021-03-10 14:23:57] <thw0rted> You can use the [<-LINK->] to make a precompiled bundle, or you can do the [<-LINK->] .  I've used the former but not the latter.  It's a little bit of a headache and didn't actually help my use case
[2021-03-10 14:24:39] <thw0rted> Of course if you use the cacheable file from your server (via external or DLL reference), Webpack can't tree-shake for you

Is there any general way to do this?I have the similar question, I tried different automatic code splitting strategies on WP 4/5 but nothing worked as well as manually splitting out a vendor chunk on WP 3 for me. I didn't manage to do reproduce it on the newer versions, I tried multiple tutorials but I struggle to get it to work exactly as with webpack 3.Hm when  I think about it, in your case its not a vendor chunk, you could just create a separate entrypoint and include it in the HTML
[2021-03-10 16:24:33] <valentin9> thw0rted: Do you think I could use the DLL Plugin to create a custom vendor file in webpack 4/5?  :D
[2021-03-10 20:01:55] <ryanbas21> I'm struggling with a complex webpack setup. Specifically the problem i'm having is we have a global stylesheet in a node_module, where its referenced in stylesheets in a monorepo as./globalVariables.css. I'm trying to use postcss / css-loader to import it in as such but i haven't got it working. Is there a way to do it with the more recent versions of plugins, our current plugins are many majors out of date
[2021-03-11 08:29:52] <henritoivar> Thanks to everyone who checked it out! Serverless Invoices got [<-ISSUE->] Product Of the Day!
[2021-03-11 09:04:08] <thw0rted> Valentin, it's not exactly a "vendor file" but yeah, the DLL plugin makes a bundle that you include via reference.  The way I understand it, all the module metadata / exports / whatever get saved in a sort of index file, which the DLL reference plugin understands. Since the contents of the DLL have already been built and indexed, Webpack knows where to get them and doesn't have to introduce any new assets to the pipeline to provide them.

[2021-03-11 14:43:56] <mauritslamers> Hi all, what would be the best way to deal with a project in which the subproject is developed as well at the same time, and both have a separate webpack.config.js file?
[2021-03-11 14:44:30] <mauritslamers> I would like that the top project automatically also builds the subproject
[2021-03-11 14:52:22] <mauritslamers> The specific problem I am running into is that I have a subproject (which is a library) having its own webpack.config.js, but when I refer to this subproject in the main project webpack config with "dependOn", it says entry not found. I understand that it has not been found, but I would like to know how I can make the main project webpack config see the "scope" of the subproject config
[2021-03-11 14:53:50] <mauritslamers> should I use runtime instead of dependOn?
[2021-03-11 16:36:45] <elisabetperez> Hey guys, I'm working with webpack 4 on a project where my src folder is called app and dist is docs instead. My file-loader is  ignoring my fonts and no matter what I do the output is all the time the same (localhost/fonts/proxima-nova/ProximaNova-Regular.ttf) even if my file loader is set up this way: [<-CODE->] Images, css, scss and html are working okay. What am I missing? Is it the names of the folders for this very particular loader? _(ツ)_/Thanks in advance
[2021-03-11 16:48:59] <ryanbas21> I'm struggling with upgrading our outdated css loaders. I have a lot of warnings related to"export 'default' (imported as 'styles') was not found in <file>"
[2021-03-12 02:56:43] <dMedia5> Anyone around using module federation in webpack 5?
[2021-03-12 03:15:48] <fivethreeo> dMedia5: yes
[2021-03-12 03:24:42] <fivethreeo> mauritslamers: not possible to do that, the best might be to make the library use a watching compiler and make the project consuming it watch the dist dir of the library.
[2021-03-12 03:44:46] <dMedia5> fivethreeo: Do you have a process for developing remote modules outside of the shell? Ideally I would just run webpack dev server locally, but i would also need the shell running locally as well. Is there a way around this to develop a remote module in isolation?
[2021-03-12 12:52:58] <mauritslamers> fivethreeo: So, that means webpack completely depends on package.json for referring to outside / external modules?
[2021-03-12 21:55:56] <ryanbas21> Has anyone upgraded to webpack 5 and had an issue being thrown inurl.jspackage on charCodeAt is not a function
[2021-03-12 22:28:13] <fivethreeo> dMedia5: I would just make a simple example using the federated module and run one devserver for the federated module and one for the example
[2021-03-12 22:30:13] <fivethreeo> In Razzle we have a example with a monorepo that runs two devservers with bi-directional federation.
[2021-03-12 22:31:32] <fivethreeo>  [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-12 22:49:13] <mauritslamers> Can anyone tell me how I could create an entry consisting of other entries? I am trying to get a bundle of a subset of entries in the same webpack file, which actually loads/includes those bundles
[2021-03-12 23:13:28] <fivethreeo> mauritslamers: webpack5?
[2021-03-12 23:13:33] <mauritslamers> yes
[2021-03-12 23:14:20] <mauritslamers> I now tried it as a no-op js file, with dependOn defining the bundles to include, but that obviously doesn't work
[2021-03-12 23:15:01] <mauritslamers> important note: I am trying to build a non-module library (pre es5 strict)
[2021-03-12 23:19:53] <fivethreeo> I think the best way is to generate the entrypoint configuration from a custom datastructure where you can list entrypoints aswell as modules.
[2021-03-12 23:23:47] <fivethreeo> so just take the config you have, add a includeEntrypoints key, then process that to add the modules in the other entrypoints to the entrypoint with includeEntrypoints
[2021-03-12 23:28:29] <fivethreeo> Or if some parts are built seldom use dllplugin and import in the entrypoint  entry
[2021-03-12 23:29:15] <mauritslamers> I am trying to find any docs on includeEntrypoints...
[2021-03-12 23:29:52] <fivethreeo> It is just a name i came up with
[2021-03-12 23:30:45] <mauritslamers> ah ok :)
[2021-03-12 23:31:45] <fivethreeo> But it may be better ways if you tell the purpose
[2021-03-12 23:32:48] <mauritslamers> So, I have this library, which is pre ES5 strict, so simply a bunch of js files which expect to be running in a single global env
[2021-03-12 23:33:13] <mauritslamers> this library consists of several sublibs, each in a different folder.
[2021-03-12 23:34:59] <mauritslamers> I want to try to build this library with webpack. My attempt at the moment is to make of every sublib an "index.js" file, which requires all the files belonging to a sublib in the correct order. Every sublib has a separate entry in the webpack config.
[2021-03-12 23:36:32] <mauritslamers> For the basic use of this library, I don't need all sublibs, but a selection of those. I want to be able to export this basic set under a single name, so in a different project I can simply "require" it, and have it loaded before the project (which depends on this lib) starts
[2021-03-12 23:37:22] <fivethreeo> Is this a browser or node module?
[2021-03-12 23:37:29] <mauritslamers> browser
[2021-03-12 23:38:15] <mauritslamers> My current attempt was to try to make a separate bundle, which has the basic set of sublibs as dependencies through dependOn. If I use dependOn without an "import" it fails. if I say "myLib: ['sublib1','sublib2']" it also fails
[2021-03-12 23:38:46] <mauritslamers> because it cannot resolve sublib1 or 2
[2021-03-12 23:42:37] <mauritslamers> I understand that, because they are not "modules" in that sense, they don't have a package.json. They do get built as chunks / bundles. The separate bundle I created has the (empty) index.js, plus an array of dependency bundles. This separate bundle is set as main in the package.json for the lib. For the project I setup a resolve where it picks up the lib. The project build does include the separate bundle, but when loaded in the browser, the dependencies of the separate bundle are not loaded.
[2021-03-12 23:51:31] <fivethreeo> I think DllPlugin could work for your purpose. Build each sublib as dll library and use import in the entry

[2021-03-14 13:39:38] <kumarldh> why is webpack generating this codeif(typeof  !== "undefined") return resolve();
[2021-03-14 14:53:32] <saurabhmehta1601> Hello Everyone , I am new to open source . Can you suggest / guide me on how to get started on contributing to webpack ?
[2021-03-14 16:49:11] <kumarldh>  [<-CODE->] Was my mistake, I have progressed from no compilations to new error  Initialization of sharing external failed: ReferenceError: SimpleButton is not defined
[2021-03-15 07:27:15] <saurabhmehta1601> I am having problem in running tests for the webpack repository  The tests are not running  on using the script yarn test instead 125909 errors message printed with message    error  Deleteprettier/prettier
[2021-03-15 09:34:00] <thw0rted> Your .d.ts files are created by Typescript, so you'd be better off asking in that channel.  The short version is yes, .d.ts files should be excluded by your.gitignorelike any other build output
[2021-03-15 09:35:53] <thw0rted> But that should already be covered by the rule that excludes your other build output -- Webpack'soutput.path, default "dist"
[2021-03-15 09:38:14] <thw0rted> prettieris a code formatting tool.  It sounds like your Git is configured in a way that converts newlines on checkout, andprettieris running before the actual tests and enforcing a rule that line-endings should be LF rather than CR/LF
[2021-03-15 09:40:19] <thw0rted> So you'd need to wipe your copy of the repository, reconfigure Git to preserve newlines on checkout.  I think the setting iscore.autocrlf=input
[2021-03-15 13:53:48] <saurabhmehta1601> thank you very much  for your suggestion . can you please tell me what does this command do

[2021-03-15 15:19:38] <thw0rted> Yarn probably has its own channel here somewhere, I'm still using vanilla NPM so I can't tell you exactly what to do there.  I know the dev version of NPM CLI (7.x) has started to take peer dependencies more seriously, so you wind up in a situation like yours pretty often where several transitive dependencies expect different (slightly incompatible) versions of a common package
[2021-03-15 15:20:40] <thw0rted> and before just runningnpm installwould make a best effort to pick one and not bug you about it, but now you need extra CLI arguments to work around it (because seriously, are you going to get every package you use to agree on a single version of whatever dep it is?)
[2021-03-15 15:21:28] <thw0rted> In your case with vanilla NPM my first step would be to look throughnpm lsand see what 4 deps are all trying to load (different versions of) lodash
[2021-03-15 15:24:36] <thw0rted> It does seem like just installing 4.17.21 should make all of those happy, per [<-LINK->]

[2021-03-17 14:51:19] <Numline1> Hey folks :) I might be looking in a wrong place, but we're having this strange issue. So we have a fairly low-cost dev server, it's a $10 droplet on DigitalOcean. Whenever we run a build (yarn prod) it gets stuck at 95% or 98% emitting. The issue is resolved whenever we add a second core, however I was wondering whether there's some sort of internal timeout in Webpack or Laravel Mix that should be considered? It's difficult to debug, since it could either be CircleCI, or PHP Deployer or Yarn or Webpack or even Mix that's enforcing this, but that's all I have. It timeouts after about 10ish minutes with Error code -1 and causes the entire deploy/build to fail. Thx for any suggestions
[2021-03-17 14:53:04] <Numline1> Here's pretty much all I can give you in terms of error log - [<-LINK->] 
[2021-03-17 14:53:21] <Numline1> the stuff inbetween has some sensitive stuff like project name etc. I'm not allowed to disclose :/

[2021-03-17 15:46:50] <eamon.woortman_gitlab> Have you tried setting ano_output_timeoutflag on your CircleCI task? [<-LINK->]

[2021-03-17 17:49:32] <Numline1> eamon.woortman_gitlab: I wasn't aware of that, I'll check our CircleCI config. It might be that it times out when there's no change on the CLI
[2021-03-17 17:49:33] <Numline1> thx
[2021-03-17 17:50:23] <Numline1> oh okay, not it probably. It's set to 30 mins on our setup, plus the CircleCI itself seems to continue with other commands once the build fails. so it's likely Deployer or Webpack (Mix)

[2021-03-18 08:07:35] <mauritslamers> Hi all, I am trying to create a webpack config for a non-module ES5 framework. This framework consists of subframeworks. I tried to generate the subframeworks as dlls, and then have an index.js file which imports the required subframeworks. This index.js is also built as a dll, and exported through package.json. I now try to import this in an app, which is assembled through a custom webpack config which inserts all the files in the correct order in the entries. I set the dependency to the framework, also using ProvidePlugin to have it automatically imported in every file, but for some reason it doesn't work at all. I see at least parts of the dlls on the top of the js bundle, but they are not evaluated, and the provide plugin doesn't seem to do anything in providing a global (which this system being ES5 depends on).
[2021-03-18 08:28:49] <mauritslamers> The variable which should be exported in the library also doesn't appear in the webpack module cache.

But for this use case, I don't think it will work for me. What I would like though, is to create a loader that "depends" on the url-loader, so whenever someone uses my loader, they will implicitly add the url-loader as-well.Is it possible to explicitly depend on another loader, or implicitly use it within my custom loader?
